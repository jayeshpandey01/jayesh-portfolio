                        Born in Mumbai in November 2004, I embarked on my educational journey with fervor and determination. My schooling, from L.KG to 10th grade, was completed at Faith English High School in Mumbai, where a unique blend of traditional education and innovative approaches shaped my formative years. Continuing my academic pursuit, I earned my 11th and 12th grades with distinction from Satish Pradhan Dnyanasadhana College, Thane, securing an impressive A grade. This strong foundation set the stage for my future endeavors in the field of technology.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With a passion for technology and innovation, I set my sights on engineering and successfully cleared the engineering entrance exam with a commendable rank of 3k across Mumbai. This achievement opened the doors to a top management college in Maharashtra, where I pursued a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering at PVGCOE Nashik. Throughout my academic journey, I demonstrated a keen interest in learning and exploring new technologies, including AI, ML, and app development, earning recognition in various competitions such as securing the runner-up position in the AI Tools Competition and being a finalist in the SIH2023 Hackathon.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Driven by a desire to make a meaningful impact in the field of education, I ventured into entrepreneurship during my college years. I founded three successful startups, each catering to the needs of students at different stages of their academic journey. The first, Btechnotes, revolutionized the way students access educational resources, reaching over 100k individuals within six months. The second startup focused on providing specialized assistance to second-year students across five branches, while the third project, my most ambitious undertaking yet, garnered significant acclaim for its innovative approach and received overwhelming support from users.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As I approach graduation in 2026, I continue to expand my knowledge and skills, immersing myself in cutting-edge technologies and participating in prestigious competitions. My journey is a testament to my unwavering dedication, entrepreneurial spirit, and relentless pursuit of excellence in the ever-evolving landscape of technology and education. With a proven track record of success and a deep-seated passion for innovation, I am poised to make a significant impact in the world of software engineering and beyond.
